      <description>About this postI’ve decided to write a brief disclaimer about this post. Please don’t use this post for statistical advice. This post was mostly thinking out loud about a possible method of hypothesis testing, but in fact it just reinvents existing methods in a noisy way. Looking at the post again a few months later, I think it doesn’t tell us anything we can’t already get from existing methods.</description>

      <description>“Words were controlled between conditions for frequency and length (all F values &amp;lt; 1).”
How many times have you read a paper with a sentence like this in the Materials section? This is my pet hate. This is a problem because of:
Statistical reasons: They’re assuming all kinds of things about their variables (e.g. that they’re all normally distributed), and more importantly, interpreting a non-significant p-value as evidence for equivalence.</description>
