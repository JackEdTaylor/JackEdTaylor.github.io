title: "Data-Driven ROPE Analysis"
description: "The Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) method of hypothesis testing is fairly common, especially in Bayesian statistics. The trickiest part is deciding on the ROPE's size. If you can't decide on a sensible ROPE, one approach could be deriving the ROPE from features of the data. Here I show how you might use bootstrapping and permutations to decide on a ROPE."

<h1>About this post</h1>
<p>I’ve decided to write a brief disclaimer about this post. Please don’t use this post for statistical advice. This post was mostly thinking out loud about a possible method of hypothesis testing, but in fact it just reinvents existing methods in a noisy way. Looking at the post again a few months later, I think it doesn’t tell us anything we can’t already get from existing methods. Another problem with this supposed method is that this defeats the whole point of a ROPE. The ROPE is a Region of <em>Practical</em> Equivalence, tying the hypothesis to some practically relevant interpretation. Arbitrarily deciding on regions with data-driven analyses isn’t really informative.</p>
<p>I’ve kept the post here because I know how annoying it is to follow a dead link.</p>

<h1>The original (problematic) post</h1>
<p>Hypothesis testing is a finicky business. The most common and traditional method, null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is actually pretty useful when all you want to know is whether your data is more extreme than you’d expect by chance, i.e. whether we have evidence against the null hypothesis. What about when your p-value is non-significant though? There’s a deep-seated temptation to incorrectly interpret this as evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, this would be better described as a <em>lack of evidence</em> for the <em>presence</em> of an effect. This could indeed be because the null hypothesis is true, but it could also be because we just don’t have the data to support a conclusion either way. From a p-value, we have two possible situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>It’s significant</strong>: Evidence against the null hypothesis. Hurray, another paper in the bag!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It’s non-significant</strong>: *shrug* who knows?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
   
</p>
<p>In Bayesian statistics, the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) method is a fairly common approach to hypothesis testing which allows us to distinguish this “<em>*shrug* who knows?</em>” category into either inconclusive evidence, or evidence in favour of the null hypothesis. If it’s new to you, <a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918771304">Kruschke (2018)</a> gives a good introduction to the ROPE method. Using the ROPE method, we accept a null hypothesis if the credible interval of the relevant posterior distribution lies entirely within the ROPE. We reject a null hypothesis if the credible interval is entirely outside of the ROPE, and we remain undecided if there is partial overlap between the credible interval and the ROPE.</p>

<p>Maybe the most difficult part of using a ROPE to test hypotheses is deciding what the ROPE should be. This is not a problem exclusive to Bayesian statistics either (see the Smallest Effect Size of Interest of Equivalence Testing: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918770963">Lakens et al., 2018</a>). Some approaches focus on a cost-benefit analysis of the ROPE (with parallels to arguments about p-values), while in Psychological science, some suggest the ROPE should be defined by the smallest difference the subjects are able to detect or would judge as meaningful (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/syp5a/">Anvari &amp; Lakens, 2019</a>). Alternatively, you could derive a ROPE from previous studies and data, or build a computational model of the process you are looking at and decide via simulation on a difference you could expect by chance.</p>
<p>Sometimes none of these approaches are applicable, but you still want to test your hypotheses. Here, I’m going to outline a data-driven approach I’ve found useful before. The method consists of three basic steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Fit a model to the data you’ve collected</p></li>
<li><p>Randomly sample data to yield estimates you would observe under the null hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>Treat the x% highest density interval of your samples derived from permutations as your ROPE</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
   
</p>
<p>The data I’ll use is simulated below. There are three datasets, all generated with a simple linear model formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{i} = \beta0 + \beta1 + e_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>The datasets differ in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\beta1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e_i\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data1</code>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta1=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e_i\sim N(\mu=0, \sigma=1)\)</span></li>
<li><code>data2</code>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta1=0.25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e_i\sim N(\mu=0, \sigma=1)\)</span></li>
<li><code>data3</code>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta1=0.25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e_i\sim N(\mu=0, \sigma=0.25)\)</span></li>
</ul>

<h1>2 - Randomly Sample Data</h1>
<p>The aim of this step is to get a distribution of observations we believe we could get if there were no effect of our predictor, <code>grp</code>. The method I’m going to suggest combines bootstrapping and permutations. On each iteration, we:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>bootstrap</strong> by sampling our full dataset with replacement. The bootstrapping is done row-wise, so that each observation keeps the original information we have about it, and simulates variability in sampling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>permute</strong> the data by randomly sampling the values in the <code>grp</code> column without replacement. The permutations only shuffle values in the <code>grp</code> column, to simulate a situation in which the null hypothesis is true.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
   
</p>
<p>Here’s the function we’ll use for getting the bootstrapped, permuted data on each iteration:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bootstrap_permute &lt;- function(dat) {
  dat %&gt;%
    # 1. bootstrap: sample rows with replacement
    slice_sample(replace=TRUE, prop=1) %&gt;%
    # 2. permute: sample grp without replacement
    mutate(grp = sample(grp))
}</code></pre>
<p>We can run this 500 times to get a list of 500 datasets we could’ve observed under the null hypothesis, for each of <code>data1</code>, <code>data2</code>, and <code>data3</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bsp_data1 &lt;- replicate(500, bootstrap_permute(data1), simplify=FALSE)
bsp_data2 &lt;- replicate(500, bootstrap_permute(data2), simplify=FALSE)
bsp_data3 &lt;- replicate(500, bootstrap_permute(data3), simplify=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can fit a model for each dataset in <code>bsp_data1</code>, <code>bsp_data2</code>, and <code>bsp_data3</code>, using the same model settings as we used for the real data. To avoid having to recompile the model in C++, we can use the <code>update()</code> function to just change the data the models are fit to:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bsp_m1 &lt;- lapply(bsp_data1, function(dat_i) update(m1, newdata=dat_i))
bsp_m2 &lt;- lapply(bsp_data2, function(dat_i) update(m2, newdata=dat_i))
bsp_m3 &lt;- lapply(bsp_data3, function(dat_i) update(m3, newdata=dat_i))</code></pre>

<h1>3 - Get the ROPE</h1>
<p>If we collapse across the 500 models we got from bootstrapped permuted datasets, we get a sampling distribution of posterior samples under the null hypothesis. A way of visualising this is to overlay the distributions of posterior samples for the raw data with the samples from the bootstrapped permuted data. Here I highlight the 89% HDI credible intervals. The idea is that the 89% interval of our bootstrapped permutation samples can then serve as the data-driven ROPE.</p>

<p>The intercept is unsurprisingly unchanged, as the overall mean is exactly the same, and <code>grp</code> is deviation-coded. The estimate for <code>grp</code> from the bootstrapped permutation estimates is always centred on zero, with the spread reflecting variability we could expect under the null hypothesis for the sampled observations.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In cases when, for whatever reason, a theoretically informed ROPE is unavailable, combining bootstraps and permutations could be one solution for calculating a data-driven ROPE. It’s worth pointing out just how flexible this method is. This method could be applied to any Bayesian model under the sun. You could easily incorporate more fixed effects, random effects, smoothing factors. You could also apply the approach to non-linear and multivariate models or models with hierarchical structures.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the ROPEs do not have to come from the same dataset you use to test the hypotheses. You could, for example, use prior data to calculate a data-driven ROPE before you start collecting data.</p>

<h1>Bonus - Just Use Estimates</h1>
<p>Above, I collapse across all the models fit to bootstrapped, permuted data to get a distribution of posterior samples under the null hypothesis. If this is too computationally intensive (as it can be a lot of data), an alternative could be to sample random subsets from the posterior, or to just use the best estimate of each model. Here is a version of the plot above, using the 89% confidence interval of the bootstrap-permutation models’ <em>estimates</em> as the ROPE, rather than the samples:</p>

<p>Note that the ROPE using the models’ estimates is somewhat less conservative, however, with similar spread to the original data’s posterior. If we wanted to simulate the spread of the posterior, we could also noise-inflate this with a normal distribution, with a spread equal to that of the collapsed posterior distribution. The distributions are also less regular, though they smooth out if more models are fit (there are only 500 observations here).</p>
